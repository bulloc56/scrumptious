    	The purpose of Scrumptious is to give software developers a packaged workflow tool. Scrumptious combines a chat system and a Kanban board function that is allows for convenient communications between team members during Scrum Sprints. Similar to other websites, members will need an account and will require an invitation to join projects that they did not make themselves.
