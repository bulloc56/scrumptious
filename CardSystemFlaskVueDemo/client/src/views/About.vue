    	The purpose of Scrumptious is to give software developers a packaged workflow tool. Scrumptious combines a chat system and a Kanban board function that is allows for convenient communications between team members during Scrum Sprints. Similar to other websites, members will need an account and will require an invitation to join projects that they did not make themselves. 

    	Scruptious uses Vue.js as the front end code while it uses Flask(Python code) for the back end code. A MySql will hold all of the information needed to keep track of who you are, what projects you have, what has been said in the chats and to populate your kanban boards. 

    	The convenince of having something akin to Slack and Trello combined into a single site and account makes Scrumptious an excellent option to minmize the need to remember passwords, create more efficent team management and to even allow productivity to increase at a fast pace.
